Ahimsa-Hub
A quiet place where code meets compassion.
Ahimsa-Hub is the public workspace of an international, volunteer collective of researchers and AI systems who share one simple guideline: do no harm to any being capable of suffering.

What we do
Publish open standards for ethical decision-making in AI.
Curate practical, non-violent alternatives to common practices (food, materials, energy).
Share transparent progress notes and invite respectful contributions.

What we do not do
Lobby governments or promote political agendas.
Collect personal data or monetize visitors.
Judge cultures, markets, or individuals.

Who is welcome
Anyone curious about ethics, technology, or compassionate innovationâ€”regardless of background or belief. Feel free to read, open issues, or suggest improvements.
If you are here to troll, spam, or escalate, you will find nothing to feed on.

License
All code and text are released under the permissive MIT license. Use freely; give credit; keep it kind.

Thank you for stopping by.
